# This class is used to represent a fragment of a QingGroup.
# ODK has issues showing a multilevel question inside a group,
# so we split up a group that has a multilevel question on it
# and remove it from the group to send it for ODK.
#
# Instances of this hold the other questions on the group that
# weren't a multilevel question.
#
# See QingGroupOdkPartitioner for more details.
